## KozmikVPN
This is great for bypassing network blocks and extension-based blocks (like lightspeed relay, blocksi, etc. Note this only works on school networks that don't have DNS blocking firewalls; make sure you still try though! Also, this has been tested on chrome 104 and may not work on legacy versions where built-in VPNs don't exist.

#### Setup
1. Download a ONC file from the releases tab

   If you choose the DNS version (removes extensions and adds the chrome.google.com/webstorex functionality for people that can't add bookmarklets) and experience issues try the non dns version!
   
2. Open the page `chrome://network` on your chrome book

3. At the bottom of this page select `open file` and import the file you downloaded earlier.

   Note that when you have imported this, the button should look like this:

6. Verify that you are connected and open `chrome://restart` in the chrome browser. Note: if you get an error like `internal error` or `connection failed` try again. If you are still having issues try the other file. If you are still having issues, contact me on discord!
