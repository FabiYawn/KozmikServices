## KozmikVPN
This is great for bypassing network blocks and extension-based blocks (like lightspeed relay, blocksi, etc. Note this only works on school networks that don't have DNS blocking firewalls; make sure you still try though! Also, this has been tested on chrome 104 and may not work on legacy versions where built-in VPNs don't exist.

#### Setup
1. Download a ONC file from the releases tab

   If you choose the DNS version (removes extensions and adds the chrome.google.com/webstorex functionality for people that can't add bookmarklets) and experience issues try the non dns version!
   
2. Open the page `chrome://network` on your chrome book
